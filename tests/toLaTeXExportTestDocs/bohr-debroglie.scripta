De Broglie thought that if an electromagnetic wave can sometimes
be interpreted as a stream of particles — photons — then a particle
like the electron might also be viewed as a wave.  Recall that
the energy of a photon is given by $E = \hbar\omega$ and that
that its momentum is given by $\mathbf{p} = \hbar \mathbf{k}$.
These are the Planck-Einstein and de Broglie relations, respectively.  

# Electron waves

De Broglie suggested that an electron consists of a wave packet
built of plane waves 

| equation label:electron-wave
\psi_{\mathbf{p}} \propto \exp [i\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{x}/\hbar - iE(\mathbf{p})t/\hbar ]

where

| equation label:energy-formula
E(\mathbf{p})  = \sqrt{m_e^2c^4 + \mathbf{p}^2c^2}


The wave packet is given by the Fourier integral

| equation
\psi(\mathbf{x},t) = \int d^3p\, g(\mathbf{p}) \psi_\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{x}, t)

Consider the Taylor series for $E(\mathbf{p})$ expanded around
a value $\mathbf{P}$ around which the momementum is concentrated:

| equation
E(\mathbf{p}) = E(\mathbf{P}) + \mathbf{V}\cdot(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{P}) + \cdots

Here 

| equation 
\mathbf{V}_i = \frac{\partial{E}(\mathbf{p})}{\partial p_i}\Big\vert_{\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{P}}


Differentiating [eqref energy-formula] with respect to $p_i$
we obtain

| aligned
\frac{\partial{E}(\mathbf{p})}{\partial p_i}\Big\vert_{\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{P}} &= (1/2)(m_e^2c^4 + (\mathbf{p}^2c^2)^{-1/2}(2p_ic^2 ) \\
&= \frac{p_ic^2}{E(\mathbf{P})} \\


From the proportionality relations 
$\mathbf{p}(v) = m\gamma\mathbf{v}$
and $E(\mathbf{v}) = mc^2\gamma$, it follows that

| equation
\mathbf{V_i} = \frac{\partial{E}(\mathbf{p})}{\partial p_i}\Big\vert_{\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{P}} 
 = v_i

so the group velocity of the wave packet representing the particle
and the classical velocity of the particle are the same.



# The Bohr Atom

Suppose that the electron wave is confined to a circular orbit
around the proton.  The requirement of continuity is the requirement
that the orbit consists of a whole number of wavelengths, so that 
$2\pi r = n\lambda$.  According to [eqref electron-wave], 
$\lambda = h/p$, so we have

| equation label:momentum-quantization
pr = n\hbar

For non-relativistic electrons, $p = m_ev$, so 
[eqref momentum-quantization] gives Bohr's result,
$m_ev_nr_n = n\hbar$.
This result, combined with the classical relations

| aligned label:balance-e
\frac{Ze^2}{r_n^2} &= \frac{m_ev_n^2}{r_n} \\
E_n &= \frac{1}{2} m_e v_n^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{r_n}


yield Bohr's formula

| equation label:electron-E-quantized
E_n = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2e^4m_e}{n^2\hbar^2}

While nothing new is found, Bohr's formula now rests
upon more fundamental assumptions.
