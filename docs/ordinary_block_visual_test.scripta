| abstract
This document demonstrates all ordinary (named) block types in Scripta,
showing each with and without options where applicable. Ordinary blocks
contain parsed expressions and support inline markup like [i italic],
[b bold], and $x^2$ math.

**Document Metadata:**
- `title`, `subtitle`, `author`, `date`, `abstract`

**Section Headings:**
- `section` (numbered, with optional level), `subsection`, `subsubsection`
- `section*` (unnumbered, with optional level argument)
- `chapter`, `subheading` / `sh`

**Lists:**
- Bullet lists: `- ` prefix (coalesced into `itemList`)
- Numbered lists: `. ` prefix (coalesced into `numberedList`)

**Theorem-like Environments:**
- `theorem`, `lemma`, `proposition`, `corollary`, `definition`
- `example`, `remark`, `note`, `exercise`, `problem`, `question`, `axiom`
- `proof`

**Formatting:**
- `indent`, `quotation` / `quote`, `center`, `box`
- `compact`, `identity`
- `red`, `red2`, `blue` (color blocks)

**Q&A and Interactive:**
- `q` (question), `a` (answer)
- `reveal` (collapsible content)

**Tables and Descriptions:**
- `table` (with `format` and `columnWidths` properties)
- `desc` (description list with term argument)

**Special:**
- `contents`, `index`, `endnotes`
- `comment` / `hide`
- `visibleBanner`, `bibitem`, `env`


# Document Metadata [box]

The document metadata blocks (`title`, `subtitle`, `author`, `date`, `abstract`)
are demonstrated at the top of this document.


# Section Headings [box]

| section
Numbered Section

This is content under a numbered section heading.

| subsection
Subsection Heading

Content under a subsection.

| subsubsection
Subsubsection Heading

Content under a subsubsection.

| section*
Unnumbered Section

This section has no number. The `section*` block creates unnumbered headings.

| section* 2
Unnumbered Level 2

Level 2 unnumbered heading (smaller).

| chapter
Chapter Heading

The `chapter` block creates large chapter-level headings.

| subheading
Minor Subheading

The `subheading` block (also `sh`) creates smaller headings below section level.


# Lists [box]

## Bullet Lists [box]

Use `- ` at the start of a line for bullet items:

- First bullet item
- Second bullet item with [i italic text]
- Third item with $E = mc^2$ inline math

Nested bullets work with indentation:

- Outer item
    - Nested item 1
    - Nested item 2
- Back to outer level

## Numbered Lists [box]

Use `. ` at the start of a line for numbered items:

. First numbered item
. Second numbered item
. Third numbered item

Nested numbered lists:

. First outer item
    . First inner item
    . Second inner item
. Second outer item


# Theorem-like Environments [box]

## Theorem [box]

| theorem
Every continuous function on a closed interval is bounded.

## Theorem with Label [box]

| theorem Bolzano-Weierstrass
Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a convergent subsequence.

## Lemma [box]

| lemma
If $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then $f$ is continuous at $x$.

## Proposition [box]

| proposition
The set of prime numbers is infinite.

## Corollary [box]

| corollary
There is no largest prime number.

## Definition [box]

| definition
A function $f$ is [b continuous] at $x = a$ if
$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.

## Example [box]

| example
Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. This function is continuous
everywhere on $\mathbb{R}$.

## Remark [box]

| remark
The proof of this theorem uses the axiom of choice.

## Note [box]

| note
This result was first proved by Euler in 1737.

## Exercise [box]

| exercise
Prove that the sum of two continuous functions is continuous.

## Problem [box]

| problem
Find all solutions to the equation $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0$.

## Question [box]

| question
What is the relationship between differentiability and continuity?

## Axiom [box]

| axiom Completeness
Every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above
has a least upper bound.

## Proof [box]

| proof
By contradiction. Assume there are only finitely many primes
$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. Consider $N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$.
Then $N$ is not divisible by any $p_i$, contradiction. ∎


# Formatting Blocks [box]

## Indent [box]

| indent
This paragraph is indented from the left margin.
It can contain multiple lines of text.

## Quotation [box]

| quotation
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...

The `quote` block works the same way:

| quote
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

## Center [box]

| center
This text is centered.

## Box [box]

| box
This content is displayed in a bordered box.
It's useful for highlighting important information.

## Compact [box]

| compact
This content has reduced line spacing.
Multiple lines will appear closer together.
Useful for dense content or footnotes.

## Identity [box]

| identity
This content is rendered with no special styling.
It passes through unchanged.

## Color Blocks [box]

| red
This text appears in red.

| red2
This text appears in a darker red (#c00).

| blue
This text appears in blue.


# Q&A Blocks [box]

## Question Block [box]

| q
What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?

## Answer Block [box]

| a
42.

## Combined Q&A [box]

| q
How do you solve a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$?

| a
Use the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.


# Interactive Content [box]

## Reveal Block [box]

| reveal Click to see the answer
The hidden answer is revealed when you click!
This is useful for quizzes and self-study materials.

## Reveal with Default Text [box]

| reveal
When no argument is provided, "Click to reveal" is used.


# Description Lists [box]

## Description Block [box]

| desc Term
The definition or description of the term goes here.

| desc Function
A relation that assigns exactly one output to each input.

| desc Derivative
The rate of change of a function at a given point.


# Tables [box]

## Table with Format [box]

| table format:l c r columnWidths:[100,80,80]
[table [row [cell Name][cell Age][cell City]] [row [cell Alice][cell 30][cell NYC]] [row [cell Bob][cell 25][cell LA]]]


# Bibliography [box]

## Bibliography Items [box]

| bibitem euler1737
Euler, L. (1737). Variae observationes circa series infinitas.

| bibitem newton1687
Newton, I. (1687). Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.


# Generic Environment [box]

## Custom Environment [box]

| env Algorithm
Step 1: Initialize all variables
Step 2: Process input data
Step 3: Compute result
Step 4: Output result


# Special Blocks [box]

## Contents Block [box]

The `| contents` block generates a table of contents
(processed separately by Render.TOC).

## Endnotes Block [box]

The `| endnotes` block collects and displays all footnotes
from `[footnote ...]` expressions in the document.

## Comment Block [box]

| comment
This text will not appear in the rendered output.
Use comments for notes to yourself or other authors.

The `hide` block works the same as `comment`:

| hide
This is also hidden.

## Visible Banner [box]

| visibleBanner

These blocks are processed but produce no visible output:

## Document Type [box]

| document

| collection
docs/chapter1.md
docs/chapter2.md

## Tags [box]

| tags
math, tutorial, calculus
