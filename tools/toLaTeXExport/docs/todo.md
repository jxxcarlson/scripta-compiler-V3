# To Do

Give user intelligent error messages.  For example

- Note if there is a missing '| bibliography'
- Note if there is unsupported legacy text, e.g. "[term ..]"
- A real fix for quiver blocks: install quiver.sty on the PDF server
- A proper fix for backtick
- box block issue

Put note in manual with the example 

   This is a test: [lb] foo bar [rb]
   
This note should be under the heading "Escaping ..."
